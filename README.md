# Description

In this project I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a fictional company, Company XYZ. On the company network there is a device that has multiple vulnerabilities.  As the Vulnerability Analyst my job was to conduct a vulnerability scan using Nessus, and analyze the results to determine critical issues, and suggest appropriate remediation steps to the owner of the affected device.

# Scan Results
<img width="1057" alt="nessus_scan_results" src="https://github.com/denika01/Vulnerability-Assessment/assets/152938905/fa12ed62-e7ad-4319-9110-ba4536791b04">

After scanning the target system an extensive amount of vulnerabilities were found.
The results of the scan are as follows:
- 33 (7.02%) Critical Severity vulnerabilities were found
- 95 (20.21%) High Severity vulnerabilities were found
- 140 (29.79%) Medium Severity vulnerabilities were found
- 17 (3.62%) Low Severity vulnerabilities were found
- 185 (39.36%) Info findings about the system

Provided below is a list of the top 5 vulnerabilities found in the scan:

<b>Top 5 - Vulnerabilities:</b>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Critical - VNC Server Password;</b> this vulnerability is of a remote application, VNC server, that is secured with a weak password of ‘password.’ If an attacker exploits this vulnerability, they would be able to remotely take control of the system.</li><br>

<li><b>Critical - Unix Operating System Unsupported Version Detection;</b> this vulnerability is of an outdated operating system running on the device. The danger with this is that since the operating system is outdated, it is no longer supported with patches being created for newly found vulnerabilities to that operating system. This means that an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities to that operating system.</li><br>

<li><b>Critical – NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure;</b> For this vulnerability at least one NFS share can be mounted by the scanning host. This means that if an attacker runs a scan on this system, they would be able to mount that file, and possibly write to it. The danger of this is that an attacker can write a script that could cause destruction to the system.</li><br>

<li><b>Critical – Bash Remote Code Execution;</b> this vulnerability regards the version of Bash that the host is running. This version of Bash is vulnerable to being manipulated through the system’s environment variables. If an attacker exploited this vulnerability they would be able to remotely execute arbitrary code.</li><br>

<li><b>Critical – Bind Shell Backdoor Detection;</b> this vulnerability involves a port that allows remote access without any authentication being open. The dangers of this vulnerability is that an attacker can remote into this device, without any authentication. Once the attacker is in the system, they have the potential to make unauthorized changes to the system.</li><br>
</ol>

# Remediation Recommendations
An awesome thing about the Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner is that along with finding and identifying present vulnerabilities in a system, the scan results also provides remediation recommendations for the vulnerabilities found in the scan. 

Below is a list of remediation recommendations for the top 5 vulnerabilities found in the scan:

<b>Top 5 - Remediations:</b>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Unix Operating System Unsupported Version Detection; Remediation:</b> Upgrade the system to the current version of the Unix OS</li><br>

<li><b>VNC Server Password; Remediation:</b> Change the server password to a strong password</li><br>

<li><b>Bash Remote Code Execution; Remediation:</b> Update Bash to a more secure version, ideally the most recent version</li><br>

<li><b>Bind Shell Backdoor Detection; Remediation:</b> Close the port that has open, remote access, and close any other port that is wildly open</li><br>

<li><b>NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure; Remediation:</b> Configure NFS to allow only authorized hosts to mount its remote shares</li><br>

# Conclusion
After conducting the vulnerability scan and reviewing the results, I provided a report to Company XYZ of my findings and recommendations.

The next step in this process is for Company XYZ to take actions to remediate the vulnerabilities that were found.  After actions have been taken to remediate the vulnerabilities another scan should be conducted to assure that the vulnerabilities have been resolved, and to check for any new vulnerabilities, if any.

Like my other projects, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.  Through this project I had the opportunity to explore more areas of the Nessus vulnerability scanner, and also how to categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities according to severity and CVSS scores.
