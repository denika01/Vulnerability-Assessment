# Description

In this project I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a fictional company, Company XYZ. On the company network there is a device that has multiple vulnerabilities.  As the Vulnerability Analyst my job was to conduct a vulnerability scan using Nessus, and analyze the results to determine critical issues, and suggest appropriate remediation steps to the owner of the affected device.
